# Hydrax
A machine learning (ML) enabled non-invasive hydration and stress level tracking system.
Performed feature selection, extraction and thereafter trained the dataset on several ML models
The Galvanic Skin Response Sensor is used to measure the skin conductance level and predictions are made using trained ML 
models.
It accurately estimates the hydration level in human skin using galvanic skin response (GSR) of the human body.
